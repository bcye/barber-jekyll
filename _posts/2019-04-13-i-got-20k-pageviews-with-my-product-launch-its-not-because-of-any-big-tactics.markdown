_It is my dream come true. I made a product that people truly love. And I went viral._

### A short recap on the product

Before diving in let's look back at the launch and at the product that I launched.

I launched my browser extension, **[Hello, Goodbye](https://hellogoodbye.app),** about 3 weeks ago to fight back against the increasing usage of annoying chat widgets being used across the web.

### The launch

I scored #2 product of the day on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hello-goodbye/). This gave me around 3K page views on launch day.

I was #1 on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19408329) for around 8 hours, which brought about 6K page views.

<!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-13-at-10.16.53.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>This was the Show HN that made me go viral.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->

After about a week I was featured on [LifeHacker](https://lifehacker.com/block-customer-service-chat-pop-ups-with-this-browser-e-1833414787) and various other smaller blogs.

<!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-13-at-10.19.38.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The lifehacker article, 3 days after the launch</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->

After 2 weeks I had accumulated about 20K page views.

<!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-13-at-10.22.36.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>that's fathom analytics if you're curious (<a href="https://usefathom.com">https://usefathom.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->

Now, how did these numbers happen?

### Factor #1: Luck

I was being lucky. [@jamesivings](https://twitter.com/jamesivings) came up with the idea actually a month earlier than me, but he didn't get around to do it. So, I had a great problem that needed to be solved, and a lot of people liked it.

### Factor #2: Comments. Lots of them.

If you look back at the products on ProductHunt of that day, you'll find plenty that had more likes than Hello, Goodbye.

<!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-13-at-10.26.28.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>comments.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->

Why did my product get ranked higher than those with more upvotes? I had tons of people commenting about how they use Intercom on their sites, that they like it, or that they are annoyed. Honestly, I was surprised how much people wanted to talk about this product. I felt like I had opened Pandora's Box.

So, for your next project: try to build something that will have people talking because it solves a real problem. _(If that is just not the case or you already started, include something controversial in your post, it'll work almost as well)_ It will not only generate comments and bring you to the top of platforms like HackerNews and ProductHunt, but people will be much more likely to share it on Twitter, which leads into factor number three...

### Factor #3: Shares, people wanted to share the extension with their friends

Like myself, there were a lot of people for who the extension solved a problem. And when a problem is solved, people mysteriously want to tell others about it.

That's what happened on Twitter, while I was on ProductHunt and HackerNews, there were a lot of people tweeting about it (and some still are).

The tweets were either discussions on if this is good, or just one-liner shares to spread the word. Those tweets can be huge. Especially after launch day, when you need to stay relevant without help from PH and HN.

### Final Word

Before closing off this article, here is a quick and friendly reminder:

Before you go live. **Check that all your systems are working (i.e. email and analytics)!**

_2 weeks after launching I found out my email didn't work. Ouch, I will never know what I missed out on._
