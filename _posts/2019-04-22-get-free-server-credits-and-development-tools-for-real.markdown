## How to apply:

[Go to this website](https://education.github.com/pack) and login with your GitHub Account. GitHub will ask you some nice questions and you'll either need to put in your school email or take a picture of your student ID. About 2 days later you should be able to go to [the offers site](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) and redeem everything.

## DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean, really a no-brainer. You get $50 in server credits to spend over 12 months.

### What can you build with it?

2 ideas to get your creativity started:

- Create a blog like this one with the [Ghost One-Click Server](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ghost)
- Replace Google Analytics with an open source privacy-focused tool, like [Fathom Analytics](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/fathom-analytics)

[Before you redeem: Get a $1oo more and keep this server up ;) (thank you)](https://m.do.co/c/bd4368aa4d78)

## Heroku (more server credits)

Yes, more server credits. This time, one server for free, for two years. Sounds good, right?

### What can you build with it?

- Again, [Fathom Analytics](https://tj.ie/fathom-analytics/) is an awesome candidate to start with. Be warned, after 20K page clicks you will need to upgrade your database though.
- There is the option to install Ghost, though in my experience it did not work at all.

## A free domain with Namecheap

Get a free .me domain on Namecheap (noticed the URL you're visiting right now?) for one year. Looking for ideas to use it for? Read on.

### What can you build with it?

- Combine this with DigitalOcean and build a free Ghost blog on the domain (like me)
- Combine this with GitHub pages and create a Portfolio for yourself
- Combine this with GitHub pages and Jekyll and create a blog.

## Free continuous integration with Travis CI

Continuous Integration has really helped me become a better developer, by forcing me to write tests and pass a linter. It really helps, even with solo projects. There is really no reason to not get it.

### What can you do with it?

- Automise deployment
- Write better software with tests
- Get an awesome badge for your README

## Debug your applications better with Sentry

Sentry is an awesome tool to track errors in your products. Surprise, you get it for free with the pack.

### What can you do with it?

- Include an easy feedback option in your projects
- Know when your app is crashing
- Track errors

## Every. Single. JetBrains. IDE.

JetBrains makes awesome IDEs and they are giving the pro versions away for free with the developer pack.

### What can you build with it?

- Use PyCharm to better develop Django and Flask applications, or just build better python
- Use WebStorm to make awesome websites.

_[Edit: JetBrains offers their licenses without the pack as well here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)_
